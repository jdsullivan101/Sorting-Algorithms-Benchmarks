# Sorting Algorithms Benchmarks 
 Sorting algorithms benchmark, comparing sort times for random number generation.

 @Java-17

  Program that comapres the sorting time of various sorting algorithms including:
  -Bubble Sort
  -Selection Sort
  -Marge Sort
  -Insertion Sort
  -Count Sort

  The main method is located inside the Implementation class. The Random class is used to generate the random array of integers ranging in size from 0 to 10000.
  The main method also contains a parameter of various sizes for the array, from 100 integers to 10000 integers. The program then sorts these arrays based on the 
  different sorting algorithms and presents the time needed to sort these to user in a table format either in the IDE environemt or on a command line interface.

  The program is designed to show the time complexitites of algorithms used to sort through data and the importance of avoiding algorithms that contain exponential growth rates.
